This is just a side project to practice with the following:
-Python
-Eel 3rd Party Module for Python GUI
-Free weather API
-General experimentation and code optimization


----STATUS----
Pause in commits due to recent life events. 

This project is on hold while I work on something that will be of practical use to me. Due to recent life events
I'll be taking a crack at a BASIC budgeting program. Think more intuitive than an excel spreadsheet, but no fancy 
bells and whistles like you find in Quicken or Rocket Money. 

Budgeting is important now more than ever, and I sure as hell am not disabling 2FA just so an app can automatically 
pull my transactions. If I'm going to manually enter data, might as well get some experience with DB creation and 
management. 

---v0.5.1--- *CURRENT*
Basic functionality. Enter zipcode, get current weather data for your location.
No sytling.
Requires your own API key.

--Next Tasks--
Add optional zipcode keyword argument, allowing the creation a .bat desktop shortcut that quickly pulls up current weather data.
Add more weather details. Wind speed direction, atmospheric pressure, precipitation chance/amount...
Add a drop down selector for options like 10-day forcast, hourly forcasts, etc. 
Add some basic CSS styling.
